## Dandrieu Harmonization
The French Composer Jean-Francois Danrieu (see [Wikipedia article](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jean-Fran%C3%A7ois_Dandrieu)) wrote down some rules how to harmonize 
a bass line in his "Principe de l'Accompangement du Clavecin" in 1718 (for the interested, see the whole book [here](https://imslp.org/wiki/Principes_de_l%27Acompagnement_du_Clavecin_(Dandrieu,_Jean-Fran%C3%A7ois))). I tried to put these rules into a computerprogram using the python package 
[music21](https://pypi.org/project/music21/). \ 
There is a small webapplication available to try it out [here](http://digital-musicology.herokuapp.com/dandrieu/)
